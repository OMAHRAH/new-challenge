        <h1>Day 15</h1>
        <h2>#100DaysOfCode</h2>
        <p>Today I learned about CSS Grid and Flexbox. These are powerful tools for creating responsive web layouts.
             I practiced by building a simple webpage layout using both techniques.
        </p>
        <p>I also explored some advanced CSS properties like grid-template-areas and flex-wrap, 
            which help in managing complex layouts more efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>Overall, it was a productive day, and I'm excited to apply these new skills in my future projects!</p>
