            <h1>Padding and Margin</h1>
            <p>Now lets go into it! </p>
            <p>Padding is the space between the content and the border. Margin is the space outside the border.</p>
            <p>Padding is inside the border, margin is outside the border.</p>

            <p>In the image above, the padding is the space between the content and the border. The margin is the space outside the border.</p>
            <p>Padding and margin can be set using the padding and margin properties in CSS.</p>
            <p>For example, to set the padding of an element to 20px, you would use the following CSS:</p>
            <pre>code {
                padding: 20px;
            }
            </pre>
            <p>To set the margin of an element to 20px, you would use the following CSS:</p>
            <pre>code {
                margin: 20px;
            }
            </pre>
            <p>You can also set the padding and margin for each side of an element individually. For example, to set the padding of an element to 20px on the top and bottom, and 10px on the left and right, you would use the following CSS:</p>
            <pre>code {
                padding: 20px 10px;
            }
            </pre>
            <p>To set the margin of an element to 20px on the top and bottom, and 10px on the left and right, you would use the following CSS:</p>
            <pre>code {
                margin: 20px 10px;
            }
            </pre>
            <h2>Practical Example</h2>
            <p>Let's see a practical example of padding and margin in action.</p>
            <div class="box1">Box 1
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" is the beginning of a passage of placeholder text used in design and printing to show the appearance 
                    of a page's content without being distracting. The text is a scrambled, nonsensical version of a 1st-century B.C.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="box2">Box 2
                <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet" is the beginning of a passage of placeholder text used in design and printing to show the appearance 
                    of a page's content without being distracting. The text is a scrambled, nonsensical version of a 1st-century B.C.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>In the example above, Box 1 has a padding of 20px and a margin of 10px.
                Box 2 has a padding of 10px and a margin of 20px. You can see how the padding and margin affect the layout of the boxes.
